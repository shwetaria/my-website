        <h1>INTRODUCTION TO PL/SQL</h1>
        
        <P>PL/SQL is a procedural language designed specifically to embrace SQL statements within its syntax. PL/SQL program units are compiled by the Oracle Database server and stored inside the database. And at run-time, both PL/SQL and SQL run within the same server process, bringing optimal efficiency.</P>

        <ul>
            <h3>FEATURES OF PL/SQL :-</h3><br>
                <li>* PL/SQL is tightly integrated with SQL.<br>
                    * It offers extensive error checking.<br>
                    * It offers numerous data types.<br>
                    * It offers a variety of programming structures.<br>
                    * It supports structured programming through functions and procedures.<br>
                    * It supports object-oriented programming.<br>
                    * It supports the development of web applications and server pages.<br>
                    </li><br>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <h3>ADVANTAGES OF PL/SQL :-</h3><br>
                <li> * SQL is the standard database language and PL/SQL is strongly integrated with SQL. PL/SQL
                    supports both static and dynamic SQL. Static SQL supports DML operations and transaction
                    control from PL/SQL block. In Dynamic SQL, SQL allows embedding DDL statements in PL/SQL
                    blocks.<br><br>
                    * PL/SQL allows sending an entire block of statements to the database at one time. This reduces
                    network traffic and provides high performance for the applications.<br><br>
                    * PL/SQL gives high productivity to programmers as it can query, transform, and update data in a
                    database.<br><br>
                    * PL/SQL saves time on design and debugging by strong features, such as exception handling,
                    encapsulation, data hiding, and object-oriented data types.<br><br>
                    * Applications written in PL/SQL are fully portable.<br><br>
                    * PL/SQL provides high security level.<br><br>
                    * PL/SQL provides access to predefined SQL packages.<br><br>
                    * PL/SQL provides support for Object-Oriented Programming.<br><br>
                    * PL/SQL provides support for developing Web Applications and Server Pages.<br><br></li><br>
